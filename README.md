# SequenceAnalysis

The goal is to design a bi-directional LSTM model that can correctly predict Solvent accessible surface area (SASA) for a given protein sequence. The data is in the data.txt file which contains
around 900 protein sequences including both Light and Heavy chains. 

The model weights are as follows:

Model trained on both chains :e256_63.tar
Model trained on Light Chains: e512_63_light.tar
Model trained on heavy Chains: e512_63_heavy.tar
